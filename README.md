# The PJDL-parser
To install pjdl-parser, do the following: 

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/file`](http://localhost:4000/file) from your browser to
upload zipped archives with .pjdl file inside. An example example.zip and simple.zip archives
are provided. You can see the uploaded job templates, see their short description, edit some
properties or delete them at [`localhost:4000/uploads`](http://localhost:4000/uploads).

This is an ongoing work, though it temporarily stalled until the middle of October, except
for minor style-fixes.
